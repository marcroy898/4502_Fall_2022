# 4502_Fall_2022
This is an overview of our 4502 project. The file structure is mainly divided into three sections: Data, Output, and Scripts. All of the python code is contained in the scripts folder and all of the data is contained in the Data folder. Most of the output is in graphs in the scripts themselves so the Output folder was not heavily used.
